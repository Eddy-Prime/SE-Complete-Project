Step implementation missing for &quot;I am logged in as a student&quot;.

We tried searching for files containing step definitions using the following search pattern templates:

  - cypress/e2e/features/[filepath]/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/e2e/features/[filepath].{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}

These templates resolved to the following search patterns:

  - cypress/e2e/features/schedule_enrollment/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/e2e/features/schedule_enrollment.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}

These patterns matched the following files:

  - cypress/support/step_definitions/common_steps.js
  - cypress/support/step_definitions/auth_steps.js
  - cypress/support/step_definitions/assignment_editing_steps.js

However, none of these files contained a step definition matching &quot;I am logged in as a student&quot;.

You can implement it using the suggestion(s) below.
