Step implementation missing for &quot;Student Sarah is logged in&quot;.

We tried searching for files containing step definitions using the following search pattern templates:

  - cypress/e2e/features/[filepath]/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/e2e/features/[filepath].{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}

These templates resolved to the following search patterns:

  - cypress/e2e/features/assignment_viewing/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/e2e/features/assignment_viewing.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}
  - cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,mjs,ts,tsx}

These patterns matched **no files** containing step definitions. This almost certainly means that you have misconfigured `stepDefinitions`.

You can implement it using the suggestion(s) below.
